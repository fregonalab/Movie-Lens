## Description
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system by using a small subset of the original data provided by Netflix. To create it, two distinct algorithms where performed, a model-based approach and matrix factorization. The model-based approach was less accurate, but much faster. The matrix factorization have got a excellent RMSE score, however demanded more computational power.
